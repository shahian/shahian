As a Java Developer, I am highly dedicated and motivated to deliver outstanding results. I have a proven history of
designing and implementing scalable web applications using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, Tomcat
Apache, SQL, PostgreSQL, and microservices architecture. With over 10 years of experience, I have developed a deep
understanding of the full software development lifecycle and consistently produce high-quality software products that
meet the needs of diverse clients. I am skilled at collaborating with multicultural teams and can effectively
communicate complex development concepts to a broad audience. My attention to detail, strong work ethic, and
analytical problem-solving abilities make me a valuable asset to any development team.
