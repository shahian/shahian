designing and implementing scalable web applications using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, Tomcat
Apache, SQL, PostgreSQL, and microservices architecture. With over 10 years of experience, I have developed a deep

analytical problem-solving abilities make me a valuable asset to any development team.
